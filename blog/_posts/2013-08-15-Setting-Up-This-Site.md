title: Setting Up This Site
excerpt: Adventure of setting this Jekyll/AmazonS3 powered website.

<p class="intro">
Sustainability is something I consider before investing time or energy. Almost everything has some sort of cost associated with it and making a quick website is no different. Luckily for me, Jekyll and Amazon's S3 online storage service provides me a way to host my site without dealing with server hosts. In terms of costs, the sunk cost to acquire a domain was small and there are no visible recurring costs for at least a year.

A lot of code on this blog was forked from a similar blog made by Allan Pope. The portfolio/blog combination was an extremely appealing combination. Already of a minimal design, I stripped down the website even more until the only visible things are images and text. This involved fiddling with a certain Snap.js library because even after I deleted the library file, the javascript code was still being called and was modifying my page elements. After half a hour of aggravation, I realized there was a library file with the Snap.js library concatenated at it's end. Sigh. Anyone know a good surgeon who can separate my face from my palm?</p>
